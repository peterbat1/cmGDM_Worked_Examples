# cmGDM Worked Examples

This repository provides R-scripts and data sets for worked examples using the R-package _cmGDM_. At present, this package is available only to selected experts for testing, comment and review.

_cmGDM_ has been developed as the first example of modelling tools to be included in the new Community Modelling module of EcoCommons.

Included within this repository is a PDF giving guidance on working throught the examples include in this bundle.

Please note that these data and scripts are meant for testing and evaluation purposes at the present time. **This resource is not designed for general circulation at the moment and is being made available to the Community Modelling Avisory Group and other selected experts for review and comment.**

In the near future, this material may form part of comprehensive support materials available to EcoCommons users. If you have any corrections or suggestions, please forward them to me, and I will update the files so that the EcoCommons support and communications team can have the best resource available for final production of support material.
